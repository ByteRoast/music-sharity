# Music Sharity

> [!WARNING]
> Currently only Android build is released, due to that I don't own a Mac.

A music share app for almost all music streaming platforms.

## How to use?

Install the app either from the Play Store or download the apk from the release page.

Now you can either open the app and paste your link to convert or directly share from your music streaming platform and then select the "Music Sharity" app.
Then select the destination platform where you want to obtain the link to share. If found you'll get a popup with the link giving you the possibility to share it.
